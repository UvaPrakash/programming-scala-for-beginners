### What is Scala

* Scala refers to **Sca**lable **La**nguage

* Scala is a general-purpose programming language providing support for functional programming and a strong static type system. Designed to be concise, many of Scala's design decisions aimed to address criticisms of Java.

* Scala source code is intended to be compiled to Java bytecode which runs on a Java Virtual Machine \(JVM\)

* Scala runs on JVM, so Scala and Java can be freely mixed for totally seamless integration.

* Scala integrates the features of Object Oriented and Functional Programming.

* Scala was created by Martin Odersky at the [École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89cole_Polytechnique_F%C3%A9d%C3%A9rale_de_Lausanne) \(EPFL\)
