### Scala Methods

#### Basic Methods

In Scala, methods starts with a keyword 'def'.

Lets create a sample method for adding two numbers. Create BasicMethods.scala with the below contents.

```
// Inefficient way of writing definition
def add(num1:Int, num2: Int):Int = {
    return num1+num2
}

println(add(4,5))
```

We can refactor the above code to improve readability and make it more efficient.

```
// Efficient way of writing definition
def add(num1:Int, num2: Int) = num1 + num2
println(add(4,5))
```

Few points to be observed

* In Scala, there is no need to explicitly mention return statement. Whatever is the last line in the method will be returned.
* Since we have only one line here, we have removed the curly braces.
* Also the method arguments takes Int type. Adding two Int also returns an Int. Hence return type of the method is removed and type inference of Scala can decide the return type.

#### Types: Any, AnyVal and AnyRef
