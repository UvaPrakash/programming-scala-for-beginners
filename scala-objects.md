### Scala Objects

#### Singleton Objects

Methods and values that arenâ€™t associated with individual instances of a `class` belong in _singleton objects_, denoted by using the keyword `object` instead of `class`.

No object is required to call methods declared inside singleton object. Methods declared inside Singleton Object are accessible globally.

```scala
// Singleton Object
object MyObject {
        def add(x: Int, y: Int) = x + y
}

println(MyObject.add(2,4))
```

#### Main method in scala

Main method is an entry method to a program. Below is an example of Java's main method.

```java
public class Sample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, this is Java main method");
    }
}
```

Let us create an equivalent version of the above main method in Scala

```scala
object Sample {
    def main(args: String[]):Unit = println("Hello, this is Scala main method")
}
```

* Objects are singletons
* Objects are Scala's replacement for the keyword `static`
* Objects are meant for factories, defining pattern matching, defining defaults and main methods
* Main methods are always inside of Objects
* You can forgo the main declaration by having your object extends `App`
