### Scala Classes

**Classes in Scala **are blueprints for creating objects. They can contain methods, values, variables, types, objects, traits, and classes** **which are collectively called members.

Let us create a sample class inside Employee.scala

```
class Employee(firstName: String, lastName: String)
```

We can compile the scala code using _scalac filename _which will create a class file.
